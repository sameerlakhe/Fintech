### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Socially responsible investment options
The portfolios draw from six exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that screen and weight companies for adherence to certain environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) criteria, along with performance. The screening process removes investments in controversial companies and those involved in fossil fuels, tobacco and weaponry

Shariah-compliant portfolio
A halal investing portfolio — one that complies with Islamic law — is another standout offering. It contains 50 individual stocks (not ETFs) screened by a third-party committee of Shariah scholars. No companies that profit from gambling, alcohol, firearms, tobacco or other restricted industries or derive significant income from interest on loans are permitted.

Low account minimum and no extra fees: The $0 account minimum for the Wealthsimple Basic offering is a low hurdle to get started. That service includes free automated deposits, automatic rebalancing and dividend reinvestment. Wealthsimple charges no fees on transfers (in or out) or trading and all accounts receive a few extras, discussed below.

Roundup feature This tool puts your spare change to work by rounding up purchases paid for with a linked credit or debit card and automatically depositing the money in your Wealthsimple account. 

Investment in fractional shares: Like other robo-advisors, at Wealthsimple, each customer's portfolio of ETFs — the exact mix of growth, international, fixed income, cash and other asset classes — is based on answers to questions about financial goals, investing experience, financial situation and risk tolerance. 

Simplicity: Practically everything about Wealthsimple's service — clear, straightforward pricing; beginner-friendly customer experience; a slick, no-nonsense website — is stripped down to provide just what the customer needs (hence the "simple" in Wealthsimple's name).
